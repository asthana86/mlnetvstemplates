/* This template shows how to use a model trained with ML.NET (https://aka.ms/mlnet) to make predictions.
 * This model predicts whether a sentence has a positive or negative sentiment. It is based on a sample that can be 
 * found at https://aka.ms/mlnetsentimentanalysis, which provides a more detailed introduction to ML.NET and the scenario.
 * Note that this model was trained on a very small sample dataset, which leads to a relatively low accuracy.
